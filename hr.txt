Thank you for taking the time to share your salary increase request and contributions at Sogeti.  We value your time at the company.  We will review and consider salary requests closer to the end of the year once the performance cycle is completed and review of individual, unit and company performance and budget is available.  This process will occur for all employees whether or not the employee has submitted a specific request.  

In the meantime, we will reach out to you if we have any questions and invite you to contact us as well, or schedule time to meet, if you have any additional questions at this time.
